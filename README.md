# svg_plot_function
The program takes five or none command line arguments. If no arguments are specified, the program only prints the table of functional values to stdout. If 5 arguments - a .svg file, plane width, height and x and y axis ranges - are specified properly, the svg file with desired function is created as well. Shell script and text files for user input testing are included. The project was formerly created as a homework assignment from course Principles of low-level programming at my university. New plottable functions will be added.
