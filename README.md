# svg_plot_function
Program for plotting desired function via svg file, where desired lies within {linear with constant coefficient only, linear with linear coefficient only, sin x, cos x}. Also prints table of functional values at 0, 1, .., 5 to stdout. Shell script and text files for user input testing are included. The program was formerly created as a homework assignment from course Principles of low-level programming at my university. The program is to be upgraded further with new plottable functions to be added.
