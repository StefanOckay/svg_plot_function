# svg_plot_function
The program expects 0 or 5 arguments. If 0 arguments are specified, a table of functional values is printed to stdout. If 5 arguments are specified properly, .svg file with fucntion plots is created as well. Shell script and text files for user input testing are included. The program was formerly created as a homework assignment for course Principles of low-level programming at my university. New plottable functions will be added in future.
